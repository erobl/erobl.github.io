Storing a full 16x16 matrix will take 256 pixels, if handled by\nthe FastLED library, each pixel is composed of 3 bytes, so 256 pixels would be 768 bytes.\nIf we use a buffer of 4 frames, it will be 3kB of memory. The ESP32 has 520KiB of RAM, so it's probably enough.</p>\n<p><em>\"Why did I pick that MCU?\"</em><br>\nThe ESP32 is incredibly cheap. It's also so much better than the ESP8266, and\nit allows me to do some weird things (such as running a React server on it).</p>\n<p><em>\"How much time will it take\"</em><br>\nWay too long, I made this blog post to force myself to work on it. If you're\nactually interested and want to pressure me into working more on it you can\nemail me at matrixðŸŽ©erobl.xyz. You can replace that ðŸŽ© with the one email character.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"May 01, 2019","path":"/blog/led-matrix-1","title":"Creating a smart LED matrix - Design and components"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
